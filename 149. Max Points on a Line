comment:
1. the set of points that lie on the same line must appear within a set of point from which draw lines to other points,
   say, could been seen as a picture roughly like that a group of radiating lines from a central point. Thus, By order of
   points traversing the maximum could be found.
   
2. there's another problem: could Euclid algorithm be applied to the condition where at least one of two numbers is negative?
   In C/Java, the complementation is defined as that of, modulo = a - signal(a * b) * ⌊|a| / |b|⌋ * b. (not the Python)
   Easy to see, when one of arguments is negative, the arbitrary value of result is the same as that in which positive/negative
   sign of arguments exchanged. Thus, if simplifying fraction number Euclid could be used, but be careful that it's wrong
   exchanging two input arguments directly.
